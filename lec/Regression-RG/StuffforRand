 and that gets you the description.

  One proposal for a "big question" is what factors affect whether someone is on a
 hypertensive drug or a cholesterol lowering drug?
   - does age have anything to do with it?
   - ethnicity?
   - BMI?

  and so on.

  Second question, is how well do these drugs work?  So if someone is taking a hypertensive
med, how does their blood pressure (either systolic or diastolic) differ from those without the drug?
  Does it matter if the person was diagnosed with hypertension?

  Does the effect of the drug depend on age or ethnicity?
